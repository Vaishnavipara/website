            About Our Perfumes</strong>
            <br>

            We are a small, family-owned perfume business that has been crafting unique, custom scents for over 20 years. Our master perfumer, Francois, learned the art of perfume making in France. He hand selects rare, high quality ingredients to create memorable fragrances for our clients. 
            
            Whether you're looking for a signature scent just for yourself or want to create a custom perfume for someone special, we provide a personalized service to help design a fragrance you'll truly love.
            
            We use only natural, vegan ingredients in our perfumes. We avoid harmful chemicals and only use essential oils, absolutes, resins, and botanical alcohols to craft each scent.

            <br>
           <strong> Our Process </strong>
            <br>
            Each new custom perfume starts with an in-depth consultation about your preferences, from favorite notes and strengths to when and how you want to wear your signature scent. We take the time to really understand your personality and style before designing your fragrance.
            
            From there, our perfumer will handcraft a small batch of scents for you to try based on our discussion. We'll meet again, make adjustments, and refine the perfume until you're completely happy with the scent we've created uniquely for you.  
            
            The entire process, from first consultation to delivering your finished perfume, typically takes 4 to 6 weeks. We also offer fragrance consults for returning clients who want a new custom scent.

            "I've gotten more compliments on my signature scent than ever before! It's feminine, bold, sophisticated - exactly what I asked Francois for. I can't thank this perfumer enough for crafting something so uniquely ME." - Danielle S.
            
            "I knew I wanted orange blossoms and sandalwood for my wedding day perfume. They crafted the most gorgeous, dreamy scent that made me feel beautiful on the biggest day of my life." - Lauren J. 
            
            "My boyfriend was thrilled with the woody, masculine cologne I had designed just for him. Now he has a signature scent that reminds me of him whenever I smell it." - Amanda R.
            
            Please reach out if you'd like to schedule a custom perfume consultation or read more customer reviews! We look forward to crafting a memorable fragrance youâ€™ll treasure for years to come.</p>
